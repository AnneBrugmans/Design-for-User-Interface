# User-Interface-Design-
Preliminary designs for YYC Data Society website 

YYC Data Society wanted to update the community website and offer the user a more extensive but friendly and easy to use experience.  My volunteer position offered me an opportunity to work with a creative director and experienced web developer.  Presenting my ideas and receiving valuable feedback, these are the design plans presented, still to be reveiwed, edited, and embellished where needed.  More pages are still in work and with the need for a growing community effort more volunteers will be added in UI/UX and development process.
