# User-Interface-Design-
Preliminary designs for YYC Data Society website 

Original version 
http://www.yycdata.ca/calendar

Creative director wanted a "popup modal" where  UX perspective isn't cumbersome taking up the whole screen. 
"The calendar currently has a basic component to render some basic event details on click. 
We need to create a more user friendly and aesthetic component."
Feedback from team was given
-the popup feature is a progressive and smart way to display the event on desktop 
-it will probably take up most the screen on mobile

Design draft for desktop version submitted
https://www.figma.com/proto/uAGDvsDHHdPX12xi2ED6MO/Events-pop-up-desktop?scaling=scale-down&node-id=1%3A2

Features to enhance the user experience 
-added option button that takes user to full page 'Calendar of Events' on desktop only (if calendar is still required)  
-added 'new' to event box
-added an arrow down (on demand) at bottom for more events.  
-changed font type for another option

Feedback from team was given 
-being able to jump to the next event on the calendar quickly was a great idea and a a good feature that can be incorporated.
-idea of a search bar was liked, but rather it will be incorporated into main page.
-instead of a 'View in calendar' button, an 'Add to Calendar' will download the .ics file so user can add it to their personal calendars.
-modal is a bit busy, so only one event will be displayed at a time to keep from information overload
