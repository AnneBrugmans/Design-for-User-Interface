Preliminary designs for YYC Data Society website 

Original version

Creative director wanted a "bulletin board" design where user would have two types of posts: community posts and admininstrative posts. Admin posts could be "stickied" to give more visibility. User posts could have a built in expiry.  The want was a design where the page resembled a bulletin board, as opposed to just a simple list/grid.
