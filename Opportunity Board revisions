# User-Interface-Design-Opportunity Board
Preliminary designs for YYC Data Society website 

Original version 
http://www.yycdata.ca/opportunities

Creative director wanted a "bulletin board" design where user would have two types of posts: community posts and admininstrative posts. Admin posts could be "stickied" to give more visibility. User posts could have a built in expiry.  The want was a design where the page resembled a bulletin board, as opposed to just a simple list/grid.
"The opportunities page (maybe change to bulletin board?) will be the place where people go to find any opportunities for work, volunteering, speaking, consulting, etc. 
The current wireframe is very simple and just shows a page with a list.
We should get a better design for what we want the page to look like"
